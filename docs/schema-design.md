## Key Design Decisions

- location fields use GeoJSON Point format — required for MongoDB $near geospatial queries
- hospitals.currentLoad is a 0–10 scale updated manually for prototype; later can be automated
- No patient name/identity stored — privacy by design (important for patent and real-world use)
- specialists stored as array of objects so we can filter by type (cardiologist, trauma surgeon, etc.)
